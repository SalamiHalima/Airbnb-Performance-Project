Airbnb is an American company based in San Francisco, California. It operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The platform is accessible via website and mobile app.
 The company has two types of customers. One who hosts their place and the another who books the place for a particular time that is the end consumer utilizing the hosted place. 
Airbnb earns commission from both ends and hence have to make sure both of its customers are able to generate value from their business. They also have to make the hosted place offered on their platform provide the best services at reasonable prices and look out for the best technology to ease out the booking process for the end consumer without hassle.
