### Business Understanding:
Airbnb is an American company based in San Francisco, California. It operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The platform is accessible via website and mobile app.
 The company has two types of customers. One who hosts their place and the another who books the place for a particular time that is the end consumer utilizing the hosted place. 
Airbnb earns commission from both ends and hence have to make sure both of its customers are able to generate value from their business. They also have to make the hosted place offered on their platform provide the best services at reasonable prices and look out for the best technology to ease out the booking process for the end consumer without hassle.

### Background:
For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue.
Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more. Hence, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.
So, analysis has been done on a dataset consisting of various Airbnb listings in New York.

### Data Preparation: 	
Cleaned data to remove any missing values and duplicates. 
Dropped insignificant columns. 
Identified outliers.

### Feature Selection / Engineering
The most important step of the Data Pre-processing was to convert some of the numeric features into categorical variables by creating bins of them. 
Yet post conversion, we kept the numeric oneâ€™s handy tool for analysing. 

### Area Of Concentration:

In what time period the properties have received more or less number or reviews? 
Which months receives more bookings?
Which hosts have received the more reviews? 
Which locations are of high price? 
What type of properties are preferred by the customers? 
Which properties are available for more days in a year and in which location? 
Which properties and room types have more or less minimum night stay?
 Which are the locations that are not performing well based on reviews and other parameters? 
Which are the room types that are not performing well? 
Which parameter makes the customer prefer the property and provide a review? 

### Reviews By Year
Initial years which were 2011 till 2014, last reviews were negligible.
The average number of reviews started increasing exponentially after 2015-2016. 
After that it is slowly going up and most of the last reviews are received in the recent years of the data that is 2019 and 2018.
